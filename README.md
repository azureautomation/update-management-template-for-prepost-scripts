Update Management - Template for Pre/Post Scripts
=================================================

            

This is a template script for Update Management pre/post actions. It contains a basic list of common tasks and can be used to write your own scripts. 


It shows how to take the SoftwareUpdateConfigurationRunContext parameter, how to parse and access properties of that parameter, and some starter code to help store information about your script in Automation Variables. 


 


 

 

 


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
